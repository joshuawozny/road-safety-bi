## 📊 Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To analyze global traffic fatality data and identify patterns by country, region, and time period. This project demonstrates practical business intelligence skills — from **data modeling and SQL queries** to **visual analytics and storytelling**.

**Key Questions Explored:**
- Which countries have the highest road fatality rates per 100,000 people?
- How do fatalities correlate with vehicle ownership and population growth?
- What regional patterns emerge over time?

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- SQL data modeling and analysis (PostgreSQL)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- KPI calculation and visualization (Metabase / Power BI)
- Python and Pandas exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Reproducible documentation and GitHub portfolio structure
